Week 2 - The Parts of the Project

This week was also a fairly slow week however some very crucial and often arduous steps were taken to start work on the project.
I downloaded the midifile repository and integrated it into my project. There were some finer details that I want to point out.
First is that the cmake file has to be updated with any header files or executables to run the program. Specifically since I added
test.cpp and jazzMachine.cpp I had to add the lines,
add_executable(test ../src/test.cpp)
add_executable(jazz ../src/jazzMachine.cpp)

Another task I had to complete was changing all the paths of all the cpp and header files in midifile. 
The reason I had to do this is because my filesystem is different from the original midifile system and so every include statement had to be changed.
One example would be,

#include "MidiFile.h" ---> #include "../src/inc/MidiFile.h"

The last thing I did was record 10 solo excerpts from one of my songs in ableton. 
I then exported those songs to MIDI and put them in my project under the folder FSharpMinor.
This is the sample data that I will use to generate solos for now and hopefully, I can record much more music of my own over the course of the semester.

There was no tangible result out of this week, however there will be some results next week.
