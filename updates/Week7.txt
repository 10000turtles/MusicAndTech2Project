Week 7 - Voice Leading and Midterm Video

This week I added functionality to specify voice leading range.
This was a fairly non-trivial thing to do and it added quite a bit of
spaghetti to my code(jazzMachine.cpp). The new algorithm goes something like this,

while (not done with song)
{
  if (no options in markov table)
  {
    Find all continuations from current spot in table within a certain pitch range.
    Randomly choose one to be the next note.
    if (no continuations in range)
    {
      pick a random note.
    }
  }
  else
  {
    normally pick the note.
  }
}

Because of the way my code was formatted, there was not a simple way to
do this without adding a crap ton of spaghetti to my code. This is definately
something I want to re-work in the future. As well a big portion of time (~12 hours)
was spent making my midterm video which you can find at,
