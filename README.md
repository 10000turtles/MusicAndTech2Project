# Music and Tech 2 Project - An Exploration into Computer Generated Music

Hi. This project is meant to be a grab bag of sorts comprising many ways in which to generate new music. There are many ways to go about this and outlined here are just a couple of possible ways to try.

The first is a continuation of my Music and Tech 1 project which is the use of markof chains for solo generation. I only did a base case version of the real thing. A couple of the things I would like to improve upon are,
  -The sample size of personal midi data. I only had 1 solo in the original set so it would be nice to have closer to 50, maybe across multiple songs of mine.
  -The order of the markov chains. The original project was 2nd order but it can be extended to nth order. This is complimented by the larger data set and means more of the markov table can be filled out.
  -Adding in variation in dynamics and rhythm. My original project had only variation in pitch and so that could be expanded as well.
  -The ease of use for going to and from MIDI. In the original project, I manually transfered MIDI files before and after they were edited. Now I would like to use something a little more robust to help automate any generation.
  
What I have set out above could be called the first half of the project. The second half will be comprised of another way of generating music that is also machine learning. The problem is, I don't know enough to know what to focus on at this point. Lucky for me, by the time I exhaust the limitations of markov music generation, I should know enough to continue.
