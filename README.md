# Music and Tech 2 Project - C++ Midi Library

Hi. This project is the beginnings of a C++ library for editing MIDI. The main problem I expirienced with previous endevours in MIDI is that the applications used to go back and forth between MIDI and CSV is not portable. It was an arduous task to go back and forth between the two and was not automated. This would be one of the functionalities I wish to implement. There are two sides to this: the programmer's side and the normal person's side. For the programmers, I will make sure my functions and data structures are easy to use and well documented. For the people who have sanity, I will make a useable, portable program that can accomplish the same things as the library (albeit not automated). 

The next part of this project is hopefully to use the library of functions I have made to make some music! There are some options as to what I could do, but here are a few off the top of my head:

- Expansion on markov chain solo generation
- Machine Learning Music Generation
- MP3 to MIDI file.
- Graphical Art based off of MIDI

Even though I might only be able to get to one of these options, I think it will be well worth the effort to first spend some time to "re-write" some low-level MIDI translation code. Not only is it needed to do anything else I want to do but also gives me a chance to learn the actual structure of a midi file. Thanks :D
