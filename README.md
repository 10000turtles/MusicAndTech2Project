# Music and Tech 2 Project - C++ Midi Library

Intro

Hi. This project is the beginnings of a C++ library for editing MIDI. The main problem I expirienced with previous endevours in MIDI is that the applications used to go back and forth between MIDI and CSV is not portable. It was an arduous task to go back and forth between the two and was not automated. This would be one of the functionalities I wish to implement. There are two sides to this: the programmer's side and the normal person's side. For the programmers, I will make sure my functions and data structures are easy to use and well documented. For the people who have sanity, I will make a useable, portable program that can accomplish the same things as the library (albeit not automated).
